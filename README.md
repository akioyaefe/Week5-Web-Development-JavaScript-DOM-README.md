# Power Learn Project Week 5 - JavaScript & DOM Manipulation

Welcome to **Week 5** of the Power Learn Project! This week, dived into **JavaScript**—the powerhouse behind interactive web pages—and the **Document Object Model (DOM)**, which allows us to manipulate HTML and CSS dynamically.

## Week 5 Objectives

By the end of this week, we were  able to:

- Understand JavaScript basics: variables, data types, operators, and functions.
- Use loops and control statements effectively.
- Select and manipulate DOM elements using JavaScript.
- Create interactive web page elements.
- Apply event listeners to respond to user actions.

## Assignment Overview

In this week assignment, we are required to create a small interactive web page that demonstrates your understanding of:

1. **JavaScript Variables & Data Types**  
   - Declare and use `let`, `const`, and `var`.
   - Work with primitive and non-primitive data types.

2. **Loops & Conditional Statements**  
   - Use `for`, `while`, `do-while`, `for...in`, and `for...of`.
   - Implement `if-else` and `switch` conditions.
   - Utilize `break` and `continue`.

3. **Functions**  
   - Write reusable functions using function declarations, expressions, and arrow functions.
   - Work with parameters, arguments, and return values.

4. **DOM Manipulation**  
   - Select elements using `getElementById`, `getElementsByClassName`, `querySelector`, etc.
   - Change element content, attributes, and styles dynamically.
   - Add, remove, or modify classes.
   - Respond to user actions with event listeners (clicks, form submissions, etc.).

## Assignment Tasks

1. Create an **HTML file** for your project (`index.html`).
2. Include a **linked CSS file** (`style.css`) to style your page.
3. Write a **JavaScript file** (`script.js`) to add interactivity.
4. Implement at least:
   - One loop that outputs dynamic content.
   - One function that takes parameters and returns a value.
   - One interactive button that changes content on click.
5. Ensure your page is well-structured, readable, and functional.

## Expected Outcomes

By completing this assignment, you will:

- Practice writing and structuring JavaScript code.
- Gain hands-on experience with DOM selection and manipulation.
- Learn how to make your web pages interactive.
- Build a foundational skill set for more advanced JavaScript applications.

## Submission Instructions

1. Push your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files to your GitHub repository.
2. Share the repository link with your instructor for review.# Week5-Web-Development-JavaScript-DOM-README.md
